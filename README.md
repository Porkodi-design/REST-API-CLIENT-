Java REST API Consumer

This Java application demonstrates how to consume a public REST API, handle HTTP requests, and parse JSON responses using the org.json library. It's a simple, effective example for beginners learning about API integration in Java.

Key Features

 Connects to a public REST API (JSONPlaceholder)
Sends an HTTP GET request using HttpURLConnection
 Parses JSON response using org.json.JSONArray and org.json.JSONObject
 Displays structured output in the console (Post ID, User ID, Title, Body)
Includes error handling for failed requests or exceptions

How It Works

1. Connects to the endpoint
2. Reads the full JSON response using BufferedReader.
3. Parses the data into JSONArray and individual JSONObject.
4. Prints each postâ€™s:
